1.	Project Overview
This project is designed to perform the upgrade of some major technologies used to 
  support the course for Jay Liu at Victoria Training Center, and this document describes the detailed work items required 
    for this technology upgrade.
    
This requirement document is to request working on the following technology enhancement or migration, 
  to modernize, optimize, and consolidate the existing version of the course, SQL Server Business Intelligence (SQL Server BI).
   With the project completion, the enhanced features running on the upgraded system design will offer a better designed, 
      documented, improved, and standardized environment, which supports a new look of the technologies the course runs on, 
      and offer a nicely-looking infrastructure of the new version of the course.

===================================

2.	Enhancement Summary
The following list contains all required tasks, portions, technologies, and framework to support 
  and offer a new look of the corresponding course.
  
2.1.	Data Quantity (C1)
Currently the course only uses a small set of sample data with 1,200,000 rows. In the new version after this upgrade, 
  we will offer 10,000,000 (10M) level of rows as the dataset to show the 360-degree of data manipulation and processing.
  A simulation of the data to make up such level of amount of data would be considered.
  
2.2.	Data Age (C1)
The new version will show the most recent 20 years of data, but counting back from the current year, back to 20 years from now, 
meaning the newly designed course should show the most up-to-date data. During the simulation as enlarging the data amount, 
this should be also handled.

2.3.	New Virtual Machines (C1, C2, C8)
This project requires starting the entire project from SQL2016 (running on Windows 2012 server), 
the VM offered to the project download folder includes:
-	Windows Server 2012 R2
-	SQL Server 2016 (3 instances, OLTP, OLAP, DW)
-	SQL Server 2016 BI Installation package (on server)
-	MS Office Suite
On top of that, this upgraded version will introduce SQL Server 2017 running on Windows Server 2012 R2, so at Phase 8 (Class 8),
a new VM will be introduced, with running SQL Server 2017 instances on Windows server 2012 R2, 
and then the rest of project (C9, C10) will be to upgrade/migrate the whole environment on SQL Server 2017, 
including SQL Server 2017 BI components setup and configuration, plus enhancement from the old/existing SQL 2016 environment. 
So the new (2nd) VM for SQL 2017 will include:
-	Windows Server 2012 R2
-	SQL Server 2017 (3 instances, OLTP, OLAP, DW)
-	SQL Server 2017 BI Installation package (on server)
-	MS Office Suite

2.4.	Simplified SSIS Design and Development (C2, C3, C4)
After developing SSIS, remove the existing version of cloning and simulating multiple sites by creating multiple SSIS packages.
Instead we will use one package to deal with multiple sites, by passing in parameters to control the data sources inside the packages.
 

2.5.	Add Charts in Reports (C5, C6)
Add demo to display Charts in SSRS reports, may need to design and develop more corresponding reports for this purposes.

2.6.	Dynamic Refresh Reporting (new, C6 or C9)
A new requirement to enhance the report from the business user is to allow the report to be auto-refresh,
based on an interval (say every 5 seconds) to let the report become an actual real-time report.

2.7.	Multi-selection for SSRS Report Parameters (C5, C6)
Add handling to manage selecting multiple values for SSRS reports.

2.8.	Drill-down Reports (C5, C6)
Add drill-down feature for grouping inside the report, so groups on reports can be drill-down and drill-up (expand and collapse).

2.9.	Add Drill-through Reports (C5, C6)
If possible, design a summary-detail reporting methodology, 
to show summarized (top) report with grouping and statistics of high-level data first, 
and then allowing users to deep-dive into the next level of detailed report(s), 
a two-level drill-through (three-level) reports would be ideal.

2.10.	Upgrade and Migration (C8)
Implement upgrade and migration from SQL 2016 BI into SQL 2017 BI, design steps and process of the migration. 
Refer existing version of module 10 (class 10) would be helpful.
 

2.11.	Enhancement (C9, C10)
Develop centralized configuration table to drive SSIS package running and SSRS report delivery.

2.12.	Web-application Configuration using SSRS Report (C9, optional)
For 2.10 above, build a configuration tool using SSRS report, to allow authorized users to perform the configuration via the report. 
Ignore the permission controls when designing and developing the tool, 
as it can be managed by assigning access to the report or folder holding the report.

2.13.	Rebuild All Technical Documents (PPT)
As the running environment will be migrated to VM based, so all non-change document PPT files will be rerun and recaptured.

=========================================

=====================================

4.	Offerings & Constraints
-	Data Tech Consulting Services Inc. (DataTech) is the vendor cooperating and coordinating the projects, 
    and as the end of the projects, DataTech offers reference check for all co-op project resources.
-	All participating resources must finish all their tasks with their groups from the beginning until the end, 
    and when and only when your name appears in the last version of the registry list at the project closing time, 
    DataTech will then offer the reference service.
-	You can ask for a short leave for vacation or any other reasons, by telling your group lead or members, 
    and they are fine to cover you, or wait for your availability for catching up the progress designed by your group.
-	With absence up to THREE times of unavailability when reporting your status update, 
    you are still eligible to continue your projects, but after THREE times of missing status update, 
    you will automatically be removed from the projects for the current round. Of course, 
    you are still allowed to come back for the future rounds of projects.
